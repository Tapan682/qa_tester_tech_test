# Please note: The appid provided in the assignment (9d50450a48809637b4862bdcb125927d) kept returning
# 401 Unauthorized for me. When I did a simple search for London on https://openweathermap.org/ I noticed
# that their API call on the backend was using appid=439d4b804bc8187953eb36d2a8c26a02. For the sake of
# making this assignment work, I am using their appid instead.
# Also, their API was returning the temperature in celsius by default. So I didn't bother converting it further.
# I noticed that their API allows user to force the units to use Metric by passing in the units=metric key
